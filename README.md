## Insights and Recommendations

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Capitalize on Peak Sales Months
From the trend analysis, it's clear there are certain months where sales spike. You should dig deeper into what causes these spikes‚Äîpromotions, holidays, or seasonal demand‚Äîand replicate those strategies in slower months.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Nurture Top Customers
The Top 5 Customers are clearly contributing a lot to revenue. Consider exclusive loyalty programs or personalized marketing for these valuable clients.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Expand Market Focus
The US is your strongest market, but the UK and Ireland are also showing promise. Increasing your marketing efforts in these regions could unlock more potential.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Test Market for Medium and Light Roast
If the dashboard data shows lower sales for these types, it might be worth experimenting with promotions or surveys to gauge interest.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Evaluate Loyalty Card Impact
The slicer shows who's using loyalty cards. If it drives more frequent purchases, consider pushing this program further.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize Inventory Based on Popular Sizes
Use the sales data to adjust your inventory strategy, focusing on the most popular sizes and even considering bundle deals.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Plan Ahead with Predictive Analytics
Adding a forecasting model could help predict sales spikes, allowing you to optimize stock and marketing efforts ahead of time.

## Future Enhancements
